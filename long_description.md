Assessing use of personal protective equipment in ebola response efforts. The WHO has [new protective equipment guidelines](http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/filovirus_infection_control/en/) in response to the Ebola crisis. Here is a [PDF showing steps to putting on protective equipment](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/put_on_ppequipment.pdf). Since there is no known cure for Ebola, protection from infection is crucial in emergency response. [Changes to this guidance in response to Ebola are explained by the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/fs1020-ebola-personal-protective-equipment.html).

This project is part of the [Citizen Cyberlab project researching citizen science](http://citizencyberlab.eu). It aims to raise awareness of Ebola emergency response efforts and to experiment with using GeoTag-X to support training about personal protective equipment. Results are experimental and do not directly contribute to Ebola response action. **The UN has created the first-ever UN emergency health mission for this crisis that includes [a list of what is still needed](http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/needs.shtml). If you can contribute to emergency needs listed by UNMEER, please focus your efforts there first.**
