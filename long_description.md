Assessing use of personal protective equipment in ebola response efforts. The WHO has <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/filovirus_infection_control/en/">new protective equipment guidelines</a> in response to the Ebola crisis. Here is a <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/put_on_ppequipment.pdf"> PDF showing steps to putting on protective equipment</a>. Since there is no known cure for Ebola, protection from infection is crucial in emergency response. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/fs1020-ebola-personal-protective-equipment.html">Changes to this guidance in response to Ebola are explained by the CDC</a>.

This module is part of the <a href="http://citizencyberlab.eu">Citizen Cyberlab project researching citizen science</a>. It aims to raise awareness of Ebola emergency response efforts and to experiment with using GeoTag-X to support training about personal protective equipment. Results are experimental and do not directly contribute to Ebola response action. <b>The UN has created the first-ever UN emergency health mission for this crisis that includes <a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/needs.shtml">a list of what is still needed</a>. If you can contribute to emergency needs listed by UNMEER, please focus your efforts there first. </b>
