<p>This analysis is about whether people are wearing any protective equipment. Ebola virus disease is a severe illness caused by Ebola Filovirus. It is highly infectious, rapidly fatal, with a death rate of up to 90%, but it can be prevented. It is spread through direct contact with body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, sperm, etc.) of an infected person and by contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment, including linen soiled by body fluids from an infected person.</p>
