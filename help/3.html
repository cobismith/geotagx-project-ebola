<p>This analysis is about whether people are wearing all of the protective equipment recommended. There should be no skin exposure of people working with Ebola patients, which means all these protective items are neccesary. Ebola virus disease is a severe illness caused by Ebola Filovirus. It is
highly infectious, rapidly fatal, with a death rate of up to 90%, but it can be prevented. It is spread through
direct contact with body fluids (blood, saliva, urine, sperm, etc.) of an infected person and by contact with
contaminated surfaces or equipment, including linen soiled by body fluids from an infected person.</p>
<p>Click "Yes" if you can can see ALL of these protective items being used.</p>
<p> If there are multiple people in the photo and some are wearing protective equipment and some are not, please check whether the people who are wearing any protective equipment are wearing all of the items.</p>
<p>Click "No" if only some of them are used, or if none are present.</p>
