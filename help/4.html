<p>Ebola virus is spread not only through direct contact with body fluids of an infected person but also potentially by contact with
contaminated surfaces or equipment, including linen soiled by body fluids from an infected person. So environmental cleaning is essential following cases of Ebola. The Ebola
virus can be eliminated relatively easily with heat, alcohol-based products, and sodium hypochlorite (bleach)
or calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) at appropriate concentrations.</p>
